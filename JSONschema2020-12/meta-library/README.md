# UN/CEFACT JSON Schema draft 2020-12 meta-library publication

## Introduction

This directory contains JSON schema artefacts. They are fully based on the JSON schema draft 2020-12.
This means that they fully comply with the requirements of OpenAPI 3.1.x.  

The UN/CEFACT reference data models are provided in the library variant, with extended meta-information.  
This means that an individual meta-schema and an additional vocabulary is applied. The additional information
is included to support mapping-processes and the JSON-LD vocabulary creation.
